**Note**: If you're interested in Sailfish, you might also want to take a look
at our new software, [Salmon](https://COMBINE-lab.github.io/salmon). 

The documentation for Salmon and Sailfish is being migrated to [ReadTheDocs](http://readthedocs.org).

Requirements:
-------------

To build Sailfish from source, the following are required:

* A C++-11 compliant version of GCC.  Any version of [g++](gcc.gnu.org) >= 4.7 
  should work.

* [CMake](www.cmake.org).  Sailfish uses the CMake build system to check,
  fetch and install dependencies, and to compile and install Sailfish.  CMake
  is available for all major platforms (though Sailfish is currently
  unsupported on Windows.)

Installation and Usage:
-----------------------

For information about building, installing or using Sailfish, please refer 
to [the documentation](https://travis-ci.org/kingsfordgroup/sailfish).
